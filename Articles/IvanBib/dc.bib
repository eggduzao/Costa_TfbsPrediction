Major obstacles in this respect are that the fact that the amount of non-coding DNA is vast, and that the methods for predicting functional transcription factor binding sites tend to produce results with a high percentage of false positives. This makes the problem of finding regions significantly enriched in binding sites difficult.},

abstract = {DNA cytosine methylation is a central epigenetic modification that has essential roles in cellular processes including genome regulation, development and disease. Here we present the first genome-wide, single-base-resolution maps of methylated cytosines in a mammalian genome, from both human embryonic stem cells and fetal fibroblasts, along with comparative analysis of messenger RNA and small RNA components of the transcriptome, several histone modifications, and sites of DNA-protein interaction for several key regulatory factors. Widespread differences were identified in the composition and patterning of cytosine methylation between the two genomes. Nearly one-quarter of all methylation identified in embryonic stem cells was in a non-CG context, suggesting that embryonic stem cells may use different methylation mechanisms to affect gene regulation. Methylation in non-CG contexts showed enrichment in gene bodies and depletion in protein binding sites and enhancers. Non-CG methylation disappeared upon induced differentiation of the embryonic stem cells, and was restored in induced pluripotent stem cells. We identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions proximal to genes involved in pluripotency and differentiation, and widespread reduced methylation levels in fibroblasts associated with lower transcriptional activity. These reference epigenomes provide a foundation for future studies exploring this key epigenetic modification in human disease and development.},

Here we show that E2A and EBF1 bound regulatory elements present in the Foxo1 locus. E2A and EBF1, as well as E2A and Foxo1, in turn, were wired together by a vast spectrum of cis-regulatory sequences. These associations were dynamic during developmental progression. Occupancy by the E2A isoform E47 directly resulted in greater abundance, as well as a pattern of monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) across putative enhancer regions. Finally, we divided the pro-B cell epigenome into clusters of loci with occupancy by E2A, EBF and Foxo1. From this analysis we constructed a global network consisting of transcriptional regulators, signaling and survival factors that we propose orchestrates B cell fate.},

@article{Kanno2005,
abstract = {Both type I interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) and type II IFN (IFN-gamma) exert many functions that are restricted to immune cells. Thus, they play critical roles in innate and adaptive immunity. IFN regulatory factor-4 (IRF-4) and IRF-8 (formerly PU.1 interaction partner [Pip] and IFN consensus sequence binding domain [ICSBP], respectively) are immune cell-specific members of the IRF family that regulate the development of myeloid, lymphoid, and dendritic cells. They form a heterodimeric complex with another immune cell-specific transcription factor PU.1-Spi-1 and regulate transcription of genes in the immune system. This review describes the role of the IRF-8-PU.1 complex in modulating IFN signaling in an immune cell-specific manner. Our studies revealed that some but not all IFN-gamma-inducible genes carry an IFN-gamma activation site (GAS) element that contains a binding site for the IRF- 8-PU.1 complex. The IRF-8-PU.1 complex can take part in GAS-mediated transcription and amplify expression of IFN-gamma-responsive genes initiated by Stat1 in macrophages. Similarly, some but not all IFN-alpha/beta-responsive genes are shown to carry an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) that contains an IRF-8-PU.1 binding site. The participation of IRF-8-PU.1 in ISRE-mediated transcription results in the augmentation of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3)-induced transcription in macrophages. Thus, GAS and ISRE elements, classically defined as universal IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma response sequences, are not the same, and some harbor an embedded motif for IRF- 8-PU.1 binding that functions only in immune cells. Accordingly, the IRF-8-PU.1complex provides secondary IFN signaling pathways unique to the immune system. Collectively, the contribution of IRF-8 and PU.1 to IFN-regulated gene expression may in part account for immune cell-specific functions of IFNs.},

abstract = {IRF8 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 8) plays an important role in defenses against intracellular pathogens, including several aspects of myeloid cells function. It is required for ontogeny and maturation of macrophages and dendritic cells, for activation of anti-microbial defenses, and for production of the Th1-polarizing cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) in response to interferon gamma (IFN$\gamma$) and protection against infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The transcriptional programs and cellular pathways that are regulated by IRF8 in response to IFN$\gamma$ and that are important for defenses against M. tuberculosis are poorly understood. These were investigated by transcript profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation on microarrays (ChIP-chip). Studies in primary macrophages identified 368 genes that are regulated by IRF8 in response to IFN$\gamma$/CpG and that behave as stably segregating expression signatures (eQTLs) in F2 mice fixed for a wild-type or mutant allele at IRF8. A total of 319 IRF8 binding sites were identified on promoters genome-wide (ChIP-chip) in macrophages treated with IFN$\gamma$/CpG, defining a functional G/AGAAnTGAAA motif. An analysis of the genes bearing a functional IRF8 binding site, and showing regulation by IFN$\gamma$/CpG in macrophages and/or in M. tuberculosis-infected lungs, revealed a striking enrichment for the pathways of antigen processing and presentation, including multiple structural and enzymatic components of the Class I and Class II MHC (major histocompatibility complex) antigen presentation machinery. Also significantly enriched as IRF8 targets are the group of endomembrane- and phagosome-associated small GTPases of the IRG (immunity-related GTPases) and GBP (guanylate binding proteins) families. These results identify IRF8 as a key regulator of early response pathways in myeloid cells, including phagosome maturation, antigen processing, and antigen presentation by myeloid cells.},

abstract = {Genome-scale studies have revealed extensive, cell type-specific colocalization of transcription factors, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate in macrophages and B cells that collaborative interactions of the common factor PU.1 with small sets of macrophage- or B cell lineage-determining transcription factors establish cell-specific binding sites that are associated with the majority of promoter-distal H3K4me1-marked genomic regions. PU.1 binding initiates nucleosome remodeling, followed by H3K4 monomethylation at large numbers of genomic regions associated with both broadly and specifically expressed genes. These locations serve as beacons for additional factors, exemplified by liver X receptors, which drive both cell-specific gene expression and signal-dependent responses. Together with analyses of transcription factor binding and H3K4me1 patterns in other cell types, these studies suggest that simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors can specify the genomic sites ultimately responsible for both cell identity and cell type-specific responses to diverse signaling inputs.},

abstract = {Dendritic cells (DCs) in lymphoid tissue comprise conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) that develop from common DC progenitors (CDPs). CDPs are Flt3(+)c-kit(int)M-CSFR(+) and reside in bone marrow. In this study, we describe a two-step culture system that recapitulates DC development from c-kit(hi)Flt3(-/lo) multipotent progenitors (MPPs) into CDPs and further into cDC and pDC subsets. MPPs and CDPs are amplified in vitro with Flt3 ligand, stem cell factor, hyper-IL-6, and insulin-like growth factor-1. The four-factor mixture readily induces self-renewal of MPPs and their progression into CDPs and has no self-renewal activity on CDPs. The amplified CDPs respond to all known DC poietins and generate all lymphoid tissue DCs in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, in vitro CDPs recapitulate the cell surface marker and gene expression profile of in vivo CDPs and possess a DC-primed transcription profile. TGF-$\beta$1 impacts on CDPs and directs their differentiation toward cDCs. Genome-wide gene expression profiling of TGF-$\beta$1-induced genes identified instructive transcription factors for cDC subset specification, such as IFN regulatory factor-4 and RelB. TGF-$\beta$1 also induced the transcription factor inhibitor of differentiation/DNA binding 2 that suppresses pDC development. Thus, TGF-$\beta$1 directs CDP differentiation into cDCs by inducing both cDC instructive factors and pDC inhibitory factors.},
