# Abstract:
#############################

The identification of active transcriptional regulatory elements is crucial to understand regulatory networks driving cellular processes such as cell development and the onset of diseases. It has recently been shown that chromatin structure information, such as DNase I hypersensitivity or histone modifications, significantly improves cell-specific predictions of transcription factor binding sites. However, no method have so far successfully combined both DNase I hypersensitivity and histone modification data to perform active binding site prediction.
We propose here a method based on hidden Markov models to integrate DNase I hypersensitivity and histone modifications occupancy for the detection of open chromatin regions and active binding sites. We have created a framework which includes treatment of genomic signals, model training and genome-wide application. In a comparative analysis, our method obtained a good trade-off between sensitivity vs. specificity and superior area under the curve statistics than competing methods. Moreover, our technique does not require further training or sequence information in order to generate binding location predictions. Therefore, the method can be easily applied on new cell types and allow flexible downstream analysis such as de novo motif finding.
Our framework is available as part of the Regulatory Genomics Toolbox. The software information and all benchmarking data is available at http://costalab.org/wp/dh-hmm.

Dear Bioinformatics Editorial Office,

we would like to resubmit our manuscript, "Detection of Active Transcription Factor Binding Sites with the Combination of DNase Hypersensitivity and Histone ModiÔ¨Åcations", for publication in the Bioinformatics journal. We have made changes in the manuscript and performed novel analyses following the considerations of the reviewers. 

In summary, we successfully addressed all points made by the reviewers and very much hope that the paper can now be accepted in Bioinformatics. If you have any further question, please let us know.

Yours sincerely, for all the authors,

Eduardo G. Gusmao.
