Dear Bioinformatics Editorial Office,

we would like to resubmit our manuscript, "Detection of Active
Transcription Factor Binding Sites with the Combination of DNase
Hypersensitivity and Histone ModiÔ¨Åcations", for publication in the
Bioinformatics journal. We have made changes in the manuscript and 
performed a novel analysis following the considerations of the 
reviewers. 

In summary, we successfully addressed all points made by the reviewers
and very much hope that the paper can now be accepted in
Bioinformatics. If you have any further question, please let us know.

Yours sincerely, for all the authors,

Eduardo G. Gusmao
