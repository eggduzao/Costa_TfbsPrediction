% Overall, DH-HMM and Centipede obtained higher AUC.
%Boyle and Neph predictions could reach high specificity on low sensitivity levels, while
%Cuellar presented higher sensitivity and lower specificity. All methods were better than
%using sequence information alone.

Then, every footprint prediction that overlaps by at least 1 bp with a true TFBS
is considered a correct prediction (true positive -- TP) {\color{red} and every footprint
that overlaps with a false TFBS is considered an incorrect prediction (false positive -- FP).}
%and every footprint prediction
%that does not overlap a true TFBS is considered an incorrect prediction (false positive -- FP).
Consequently, true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN) are, respectively, {\color{red}
false and true TFBSs without overlapping footprint predictions.}
%false
%TFBSs without and with overlapping footprint predictions.
