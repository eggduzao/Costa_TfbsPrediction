Recently, He et al., Nature Methods 11(1), 73-78, 2014 demonstrated that intrinsic DNase-seq cleavage bias around transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) impacts on the performance of computational footprinting. However, such claim relies on a simplistic footprinting method and no bias correction was performed prior to computational footprinting. We reproduced and extended their analysis including six additional footprinting methods. We also applied HINT (Gusmao et al., Bioinformatics 30(22), 3143-3151, 2014) on a bias-corrected DNase-seq signal, referred to as HINT-BC. We observed that HINT-BC significantly outperformed all other footprinting methods. Our results contradict He et al., as several footprinting methods are either not significantly influenced by cleavage bias or superior than the tag count method. Moreover, we observed that the bias-corrected DNase-seq average profile around TFBSs presents a better fit to the DNA affinity sequence than the uncorrected signal.
