%will expand our recent work~\citep{gusmao2014} by the proposal of a library specific DNase correction methods and comprehensive evaluationg with several DNase libraries and %competing methods. We would like to investigate if either advance footprinting methods are affected by sequence specific bias, if bias are library specific and the effects %of bias correction in the footprinting task.

%More specifically, it has been demonstrated that the scoring method termed footprint occupancy score (FOS) underperforms simple DNase-seq tag count scoring (TC) on the identification of active TFBSs. Furthermore, it was also shown that the higher the impact of the bias on a TF, the greater the discrepancy between prediction accuracies made by FOS and TC.

%Nevertheless, FOS is a very naive footprinting method. Although FOS can be used to rank predicted footprints as in~\cite{neph2012a}, the high-resolution DNase digestion raw signal has intrinsic noise that affects prediction accuracy when FOS is directly applied to rank MPBSs. Here we test the claims made in~\cite{he2014} using more sophisticated footprinting methods. We check whether the non-specific motif-driven identification of TFs by counting DNase tags in particular regions is preferrable when compared to state-of-the-art footprinting methods. Furthermore, we verify if such intrinsic DNase I cleavage bias can be corrected \emph{in silico}. Finally, we verify if the TF-specific nature of the bias is still present when using robust footprinting methods and when such bias is corrected.

%\section{Introduction}
%\label{sec:introduction}

%Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies coupled with novel or modified biochemical methods enhanced significantly our understanding on diverse molecular biology questions such as the regulatory landscape and chromatin structure/dynamics~\citep{meyer2014}. DNase-seq, a technique in which digested chromatin fragments are sequenced to identify accessible regulatory regions, is an example of such NGS-based techniques~\citep{crawford2006b,song2010}. The nucleotide-level resolution of DNase-seq allows the accurate identification of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) through a well-characterized pattern of DNase I cleavage~\citep{hesselberth2009,neph2012a,wang2012,natarajan2012,encode2012}. Generally, TFBSs present high DNase I digestion levels at their flanking regions and low DNase I digestion levels at their protein-bound positions (footprints)~\citep{boyle2011}.

%Computational footprinting methods were developed to identify active TFBSs on a genome-wide scale. Footprinting methods are based on the application of mathematical models on DNase I cleavage profiles. They detect short regions with low DNase I digestion activity (indicative of transcription factor binding) around regions with high digestion activity (naked DNA around TFBS). These methods can be categorized as either segmentation-based or site-centric. Site-centric footprint methods evaluate the DNase-seq signal around motif-predicted binding sites (MPBSs) to classify them as active or inactive~\citep{cuellar2012,pique2011,sherwood2014,yardimci2014}. While these methods use powerful discriminative learning frameworks, they depend on an initial sequence-based motif match and will miss \textit{de novo} motifs. Alternatively, segmentation-based methods evaluate all possible genomic positions to detect footprints only from the DNase-seq signal~\citep{boyle2011,gusmao2014,neph2012a,piper2013,sung2014}.

%It is well known that NGS-based methods for chromatin biology present biases that may result on misleading interpretations \citep{meyer2014}. These biases may arise in many levels of the experimental protocols: chromatin fragmentation and size selection (enzymatic or by sonication), DNA isolation, individual transcription factor (TF) binding characteristics and others~\citep{meyer2014}. Of particular interest here is the bias resulting from the DNase I enzyme preference to cleave certain nucleotide sequences. Recently, it was shown that such bias affects DNase-seq cleavage patterns around binding sites of particular TFs~\citep{he2014}. Authors compare two simple approaches to classify an MPBS as active or inactive: (1) tag count score (TC), which consists of ranking MPBSs by the number of DNase-seq reads around their binding sites; and (2) a version of the footprint score (FS) proposed in~\cite{neph2012a}, which consists of ranking MPBSs by the ratios of DNase-seq reads within the binding site and in the upstream/downstream flanking regions. They show that the TC approach is better than the FS and that the FS performance deteriorates for TFs with motifs associated to high DNase-seq cleavage bias. 
%\changed{Concurrently, ~\cite{sung2014} indicated that footprints of transcription factors with short binding sites are artifacts of DNase cleavage bias. Authors indicate that factors with short binding time have characteristic low protection footprinting shapes, i.e. low number of DNase I cuts around the footprint. Altogether, these findings question the feasibility of footprinting methods. However,~\cite{he2014} did not evaluated state-of-the-art computational footprinting methods~\citep{boyle2011,cuellar2012,gusmao2014,pique2011,piper2013,sherwood2014,sung2014,whitington2009,yardimci2014}, or evaluated the effects of correcting the DNase-seq signal prior to the application of footprinting. Moreover, no work has explored the use of footprint protection concept introduced in~\cite{sung2014} for computational detection of short time binding factors.}

%\changed{Here, we analyze the effects of the DNase-seq cleavage bias and TFs with short binding residence time (short-lived TFs) on methods previously analyzed by~\cite{gusmao2014}. Moreover, we use a method to correct DNase-seq cleavage bias in combination with our HMM-based methodology (HINT)~\citep{gusmao2014}. We evaluate the effect of bias correction on a large DNase-seq and ChIP-seq compendia with 13 cells, 144 factors and 13 methods. We show that few footprinting methods are influenced by cleavage bias, which is not the case for methods with a good performance in our previous study. Moreover, the performance of HINT is significantly improved after cleavage bias correction. Lastly, we propose a statistic metric to score the DNase I protection level of TFBSs, which is able to indicate potential short-lived TFs. Moreover, this metric correlates with the accuracy of footprinting methods.}

%\subsection{Influence of Bias in State of Art Methods}
%\label{sec:bias-results}

%To investigate if the influence of DNase-seq cleavage bias on start-of-the-art footprinting methods,  we evaluate 14 methods on the {\tt Benchmarking Dataset} with 2 DNase-seq experiments in H1-hESC(DU) and K562(DU) cells and 88 TFs. The Fig.~\ref{fig:tcbiasall} shows the association between prediction performance (using TC performance as reference) and cleavage bias in the benchmarking datasets. The prediction performance of six methods (Wellington, Neph, Boyle, DNase2TF, Centipede and FS) have a significant negative correlation with the observed sequence bias ($p$-value $< 0.05$ after Bonferroni correction). However, even though applied to uncorrected DNase-seq signal, other methods (HINT, Cuellar, PIQ and PWM) did not present a significant correlation. Moreover, all methods using 6-mers estimates of cleavage bias for footprint detection (HINT-BC, HINT-BCN and FLR), do not have a significant correlaiton with cleavage bias. In particular, HINT-BC have lowest absolute correlation overall.

%Next, we compared the performance of all methods regarding their AUC (Fig.~\ref{fig:auc_boxplot}). We used the Friedman-Nemenyi ranking and hypothesis test for statistical evaluation~\citep{demsar2006} (Tables~\ref{tab:fn.rank} and~\ref{tab:fn.table}). All segmentation-based approaches (HINT-BC, HINT-BCN, HINT, Boyle, DNase2TF and Wellington) and the site centric method PIQ significantly outperformed TC (adjusted $p$-value $< 0.05$). Moreover, HINT-BC and HINT-BCN, outperformed all other competing methods. The AUC of the TC approach was significantly higher than FS method (adjusted $p$-value $< 0.05$).


%\subsection{Examples of Uncorrected \textit{vs.} Bias-Corrected DNase-seq Profiles}
%\label{sec:obs-pred-bias}

%To further investigate the footprinting issue regarding binding time of transcription factors, we propose a statistic called protection score. The protection score measures the average differece in the number of DNase-seq reads in the flanking and binding site regions for a given TF (Section~\ref{sec:protection}). As indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:prot}, the protection score is negative at binding sites of hormone receptors AR (-0.71), ER (-0.52) and GR (-1.19), i.e. there are more DNase-seq cuts in the binding sites than in the flanking regions at average. Moreover, the protection score can successfully separate factors with short binding time (such as nuclear receptors) from factors with high binding time (AP-1/JUN and CTCF). Fig~\ref{fig:prot} also reveals a clear association of the proteciton score and the AUC of HINT-BC, i.e. factors with negative protection score have much lower AUCs than factors with positive scores. Overall, the protection score is positively correlated with the AUC values of evaluated methods, i.e. 0.26 with TC AUC ($p$-value $< 10^{-4}$) and 0.28 with HINT-BC AUC ($p$-value $< 10^{-4}$), and negativelly correlated with cleavage bias score (-0.44; $p$-value $< 10^{-4}$). Altogether, this indicates that transitivity of TFs (as measured by the protection score) is a more relevant feature than DNase-seq intrinsic cleavage bias for indicating the performance/feasibility of computational footprinting methods.

%Finally, we investigate the profiles of \emph{de novo} motifs 0458 and 0500 motifs discovered in the footprint analysis of~\cite{neph2012a} and indicated in~\cite{he2014} to be artifacts of cleavage bias. As shown in figure~\ref{fig:denovo}, cleavage corrected DNase-seq profiles reveal no clear fooptrint shape. Moreover, their binding sites have negative protection scores (-1.33 and -0.22 respectivelly). Furthermore, we compared the overlap between footprints generated by HINT-BC/Neph in the cell type in which these factors were identified (H7-hESC(UW)) and MPBSs based on the PWMs provided in~\cite{neph2012a}. We considered only the MPBSs that overlapped DHSs in H7-hESC. We observed that 24.99\% (motif 0458) and 28.58\% (motif 0500) of MPBSs associated with a Neph footprint. In contrast, only 0.73\% (motif 0458) and 1.71\% (motif 0500) of MPBSs overlapped with a HINT-BC footprint. Altogether, this indicates that these motifs are indeed potential artifacts of cleavage bias and reinforces the importance of bias correction previously to any DNase-seq analysis.

%\section{Discussion}
%\label{sec:discussion}
%In~\cite{he2014}, a computational footprinting were questioned with regard to their performance on motifs with high DNase cleavage bias. However, such claims need a more thorough experiment design.
%First, we analyzed the cleavage bias of XXX distinct data sets from two labs. We observed that cleavage biases are distinct for each data set, but more similar within the same lab. This indicates the necessity of cleavage bias correction on a data set basis. Next, we applied state-of-the-art footprinting methods to multiple data sets and showed that only one method (Cuellar) was outperformed by the tag count approach. Furthermore, we applied the best ranked footprinting method -- HINT -- to DNase-seq signal before and after bias correction. We observed that the bias-corrected approach significantly outperformed the uncorrected version when considering all TFs evaluated in this study. This demonstrates that a bias correction strategy is able to improve footprinting methods significantly. Finally, the footprinting method evaluated in~\cite{he2014} (FS) presented the poorest performance overall.
%To verify the effects of DNase I cleavage bias, we reproduced the analysis presented in~\cite{he2014}. First, we observed that HINT-BC, HINT, Cuellar and Centipede did not present a significantly high absolute correlation between AUC and observed cleavage bias (OBS). Note that these methods already perform smoothing steps on DNase-seq profiles, which might implicitly correct bias effects. Not surprisingly, the HINT-BC presented an overall best accuracy performance and lowest absolute correlation between performance and cleavage bias. Moreover, DNase-seq profiles around TFs with best prediction improvement after bias correction matched the TF binding affinities.
%In this study, we have shown that the DNase I cleavage bias has little influence in several footprinting methods. Furthermore, such bias can be corrected with computational strategies. The regulatory landscape generated by such footprinting methods are important tools on the identification of complex regulatory networks emerging from diverse biological phenomena~\citep{boyle2011,neph2012a}. \emph{In silico} strategies for data quality improvement are crucial for the success of such analyses.
