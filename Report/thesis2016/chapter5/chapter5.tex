% Introduction
In this chapter we present the results generated by our experimental analysis on computational footprinting methods. First, we performed empirical analyses to determine the best parameters to our computational footprinting methodology HINT (Section~\ref{sec:first.hint.parameter.selection}). Then, we investigated two current major challenges in the area: the selection of an optimal footprint ranking strategy and the correction of DNase-seq sequence cleavage bias (Section~\ref{sec:second.footrank.biascorr}). Afterwards, we present our comprehensive comparative analysis, which includes our method, nine competing methods and four baseline methods (Section~\ref{sec:computational.footprinting.methods.comparison}). We also provide an insightful discussion on an unexplored and critical challenge of computational footprinting methods -- the transcription factor (TF) binding residence time (Section~\ref{sec:impact.tf.residence.time}). Then, we show an example of downstream analysis -- the \emph{de novo} motif finding (Section~\ref{sec:denovo.motif.finding.footprints}). After, we present two case studies in which our computational footprinting method was applied successfully to unravel key regulatory TFs on two different biological experiments (Section~\ref{sec:case.studies}). A full discussion on the results presented in this study will be performed thoroughly in the next chapter (Chapter~\ref{cha:conclusion}).

\section{HINT Parameter Selection}
\label{sec:first.hint.parameter.selection}

% Introduction
We performed a number of preliminary analyses to find the best parameters for our computational footprinting framework HINT. First, we studied the hidden Markov model (HMM) topology which optimizes the accuracy on identifying correct footprints (Section~\ref{sec:ps.hmm.topology}). Then, we tested a number of different combination of input histone modification data. Such test not only determined the best data input types for our computational method but also provided interesting insights on the underlying biological problem (Section~\ref{sec:ps.combination.histone.modifications}). Finally, we investigated the level of dependence our method has on the training data (Section~\ref{sec:ps.hmm.training}). 

% Overview of the tests
In the analyses presented in this section, we used the ChIP-seq evaluation approach to assess performance. All scenarios were tested with regard to their accuracy on predicting footprints using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) at $100\%$ false positive rate (FPR) on the {\tt Comprehensive Dataset}. Since we are evaluating the impact on performance of different data types (DNase-seq, different combinations of histone modifications ChIP-seq and different combinations of both DNase-seq and histone modifications) we opted to use the bit-score of the motif-predicted binding sites (MPBSs) as the ranking metric to create the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. The rationale for the usage of such ranking strategy is that it is independent of the experimental open chromatin datasets. This is necessary because: (1) this ranking strategy does not bias the analysis towards specific HMM topologies/input data type and (2) it makes the analysis interpretation simpler. In this scenario, we divided the gold standard dataset into two groups: the MPBSs that contain at least one base pair (bp) overlap with HINT's predicted footprints and the ones that do not overlap. Both groups were sorted based on the motif matching bit-score. A single list is then obtained by combining the ranked list of predicted sites before the ranked list of the non-predicted sites. The ROC curve is created based on this combined ranked list of MPBSs. These analyses were performed using data from chromosome 1 only, which was removed from the comparative analyses (in Section~\ref{sec:computational.footprinting.methods.comparison}) to allow a fair comparison.

\subsection{HMM Topology}
\label{sec:ps.hmm.topology}

% Introduction
We investigated the different HMM topologies presented in this thesis (Section~\ref{sec:hmm.topology}). The empirical test consists on evaluating the AUC using the {\tt Comprehensive Dataset} from the ChIP-seq evaluation approach. The distribution of the $233$ AUCs at $100\%$ FPR (one for each TF from the {\tt Comprehensive Dataset}) for all the HMM topologies can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_HINT_topologies}. All the HMM topologies that use histone modification data were tested using a combination of H3K4me1 $+$ H3K4me3.

% First glance
We are able to observe in Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_HINT_topologies} that the \textsc{original DNase + histone} provides higher accuracies than all other models. Furthermore, the \textsc{histone-only model} provides the lowest accuracies. This relates to the fact that the \textsc{histone-only model's} footprints are large and do not capture the spatial specificity provided by the higher-resolution DNase-seq data.

% Friedman-Nemenyi
We performed a Friedman-Nemenyi test on the distribution of accuracies from different HMM topologies to assess statistical significance. The results can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:fn_gusmao_HINT_topologies}. We observed that indeed the \textsc{original DNase + histone model} significantly outperforms all other topologies. This analysis shows that the proper integration of DNase-seq and histone modifications results in significantly higher accuracies than using each of these data separately.

% DNase-seq+histone models
The possible reason for the good results of the \textsc{original DNase + histone} topology in relation to the \textsc{DNase + histone asymmetric} peaks topology is the fact that the normalization methodology emphasizes even little increases in histone modification levels, leveraging the asymmetry issue (Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_assymetric_correction}). Furthermore, the poor performance of the \textsc{DNase + histone without slope} topology in comparison to the other \textsc{DNase + histone} topologies indicates that even with more complex models ($4$ \emph{vs} $2$ variables and $8$ \emph{vs} $4$ states, respectively) the slope signal and the additional states are crucial in the accurate delineation of the footprints.

% DNase-only model and histone-only
It is interesting to observe that the \textsc{DNase-only} HMM topology provides high accuracies (significantly better than the \textsc{DNase + histone without slope} and \textsc{histone-only} topologies) and is competitive with the \textsc{original DNase + histone} and \textsc{asymmetric peaks DNase + histone} topologies. This fact shows the power of the DNase-seq data on identifying TF footprints. On the other hand, although the \textsc{histone-only} topology presents significantly lower accuracies than all other topologies (median AUC $= 71\%$), it is still a better choice than purely sequence-based approaches (median AUC $= 62\%$).

Although the leftmost peak from the peak-dip-peak pattern of the H3K4me3 contains very small count signals (very close to the background signal, in this region), \textsc{original DNase + histone} HINT topology is still capable of predicting the footprints within the DNase hypersensitivity site (DHS).

\subsection{Combination of Histone Modifications}
\label{sec:ps.combination.histone.modifications}

% Introduction
We have performed an empirical test on the predictive power of combining different histone modifications using HINT's \textsc{original DNase + histone} HMM topology. In this test we considered the histone modifications H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac and the histone variant H2A.Z (referred to with the term ``histone modification'', for simplicity of notation). The presence of such histones modifications are associated with active regulatory regions. We compared the performance using each of these histone modifications individually ($5$ prediction sets, one for each histone modification). We also evaluated the combination of all pairs and triples of histone modification signals by simply merging all predicted sites (as described in Section~\ref{sec:hint.method.execution}). Such combinatorial analysis generates $20$ additional prediction sets ($10$ pairs and $10$ triples). Note that extending to further combinations would deviate from one of the main goals of this study, which is to create a consistent map of active transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) with few genome-wide assays. We tested all the $25$ combinations using the ChIP-seq evaluation {\tt Comprehensive Dataset} gold standard.

% Figure and FN overall
Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_HINT_histones} presents the distribution of AUCs for all histone modification models tested plus the \textsc{DNase-only} HMM topology for comparison purpose. We observed that most methods presented the region between the first and third quartiles approximately between AUCs $80\%$--$95\%$. In order to test the statistical relevance of these differences, we performed a Friedman-Nemenyi test. The Table~\ref{tab:fn_gusmao_HINT_histones} shows the accuracy ranking for all histone modification combinations in decreasing order, providing information on which models significantly outperformed others.

% Result
Overall, results indicate that combinations with more histone modifications are better than single-histone models. Several combinations of three marks (H3K4me1+H3K4me3+H3K9ac, \linebreak H3K4me1+H3K4me3 +H3K27ac, H2A.Z+H3K4me1+H3K4me3, H2A.Z+H3K4me3+H3K9ac and H3K4me3+H3K9ac+H3K27ac) were similarly good, i.e. their AUC are not significantly lower than any other combination. Similarly, if we only consider individual and pairs of histone modification, H3K4me1+H3K4me3, H3K4me3+H3K9ac, H3K4me3+H3K27ac, H2A.Z+H3K4me3 and \linebreak H3K4me1+H3K9ac have similar AUCs. This indicates that any combination of these histone modifications, whenever available, would perform equally well. Nevertheless, we observed that the \textsc{DNase-only} topology outperforms a few \textsc{DNase + histone} modification combinations significantly. This represents further evidence of the importance of such high-resolution signal and might explain previous failed attempts to improve the accuracy of TF predictions by introducing histone modifications individually~\citep{pique2011,cuellar2012}.

\subsection{HMM Training}
\label{sec:ps.hmm.training}

% Introduction
The annotation of certain genomic regions with the HMM states in order to train HINT is laborious. Therefore, we decided to analyze whether HINT's performance is impacted by training and applying the method to data from different cell types. In this particular empirical test, we used {\tt Comprehensive Dataset}'s evaluation data for four cell types: H1-hESC ($29$ TFs), HeLa-S3 ($20$ TFs), HepG2 ($21$ TFs) and K562 ($59$ TFs).

% The test
We have compared the AUC values of HINT when it was trained in a particular cell type and executed in the same cell type it was trained \emph{vs} the other three cell types. The Friedman-Nemenyi test was applied to assess statistical significance.

% Figure
Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_HINT_training} shows the results for all models applied to all cell types tested. Each set of four boxplots represent one of the four HINT models (trained with data from one of the four cell types), which was applied to the signal generated from the cell type labeled on the bottom of the set. Statistical significance are directly represented in the graph.

% Results
We can observe in Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_HINT_training} that only in one out of twelve cases the AUC levels are significantly different ($p$-value $< 0.05$). This corresponds to the HepG2 model, when used to generate footprints in the same cell type and in K562 cell type. These results suggest that our signal processing workflow and HMM model are able to robustly mitigate differences between distinct cell type signals. Consequently, we can consider HINT cell-type training-independent. The practical implication of such an important characteristic is that a simple application of a model already stored in our software tool, trained for a particular cell type, is sufficient to generate accurate predictions for any other cell type, without the need to re-train the model. Furthermore, this is evidence that the patterns that make the grammar of active TFBSs are similar between different cells.

\section{Footprint Scoring and Sequence Cleavage Bias Correction}
\label{sec:second.footrank.biascorr}

% Introduction
In this section we focused on two important challenges regarding computational footprinting methods. First, we performed a series of empirical tests on HINT and competing methods to identify an optimal footprint scoring metric (Section~\ref{sec:footprint.ranking.strategy}). We investigated such optimal scoring metric for both evaluation methodologies proposed (ChIP-seq and gene expression). Second, we investigated the impact of the DNase-seq sequence cleavage bias on computational footprinting and whether such bias could be corrected to improve the performance of HINT (Section~\ref{sec:impact.dnase.sequence.cleavage.bias}). All DNase-seq sequence cleavage bias analyses used only the ChIP-seq evaluation strategy, since we require the TF-wise results provided by this evaluation strategy.

% Overview of the tests
Regarding the ChIP-seq evaluation analyses presented in this section; since such experiments required a few comparisons between HINT and other competing methods which only used DNase-seq data as input, we opted to use the \textsc{DNase-only} HMM topology to provide a fairer comparison. In analyses that involved HINT and competing methods we used the {\tt Benchmarking Dataset} as gold standard; while in analyses that involved only HINT we used the full {\tt Comprehensive Dataset}. Furthermore, we decided to use the AUC at $10\%$ FPR to capture more subtle differences in reported accuracies. These analyses were performed using data from chromosome 1 only, which was removed from the comparative analyses (in Section~\ref{sec:computational.footprinting.methods.comparison}) to allow a fair comparison.

\subsection{Footprint Ranking Strategy}
\label{sec:footprint.ranking.strategy}

% Introduction
Some competing footprinting methods also provide statistics to rank footprint predictions. Wellington and DNase2TF use read count statistics to provide $p$-values for each footprint. Several site-centric approaches provide either probabilities (BinDNase, Centipede and PIQ) or log-odds scores (FLR) of footprints. Other methods use statistics such as the footprints score (Neph) or position weight matrix (PWM) bit-score (Cuellar), to rank predicted footprints.

% Introduction
The main goal of this empirical analysis is to identify the best scoring metric for footprint predictions. For that, we used the TF-wise ChIP-seq evaluation approach to search for such scoring metric by performing an empirical test on the accuracy of HINT and competing methods. Since the gene expression evaluation differs in nature with regard to the scoring metric (footprint quality score), we also evaluated the best scoring metric using such evaluation approach.

% Section: ChIP-seq Evaluation
\subsubsection{ChIP-seq Evaluation}

% Introduction
The ChIP-seq evaluation scheme requires a metric to rank the footprint predictions. Since the ChIP-seq evaluation scheme is calculated in a TF-wise manner, we can regard an optimal ranking score to create the ROC curve as the best footprint ranking scheme.

% The test
We investigated three footprint scoring metrics: the tag count (TC), the footprint score (FS) and the PWM bit-score (PWM). We assigned a quality score for each footprint predicted using the \textsc{DNase-only} HINT method. The assignment of the TC and FS to each footprint can be performed straightforwardly using the DNase-seq data. Regarding the PWM metric, each footprint was assigned to the bit-score of its overlapping MPBS. The PWM score assignment was performed as a ``control'' experiment, since it requires MPBSs, which are only available for known TFs.

% Figure
The test consists on ranking the footprints by each of these three different metrics and creating the ROC curves based on each different ranking. Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_HINT_chipseq_rank} shows the distribution of the AUC at $10\%$ FPR for different footprint ranking strategies using HINT's footprint predictions. The statistical significance assessment in the graph corresponds to the Friedman-Nemenyi test.

% Results
We are able to observe that the TC is the best footprint ranking strategy (average AUC $= 90\%$), outperforming both FS and PWM ($p$-value $< 0.01$). Furthermore, it is clear that both FS and PWM have significantly lower accuracies than the TC strategy (average AUC $= 50\%$ and $37\%$, respectively; $p$-value $< 0.01$). It is clear that the PWM bit-score is the worst scoring metric, since it does not use the cell-specific open chromatin information provided by the DNase-seq data. However, the success of the TC metric in comparison to the FS is not so straightforward. The FS is defined as a ratio between the DNase-seq at the center of the footprint and its flanking regions. The first problem that the FS encounters is that it does not recover the absolute signal intensity, as the simpler TC metric does. The second problem of the FS metric regards the window length in which the average signal in the center of the motif and flanking regions are calculated. This issue is similar to the one discussed for window-based segmentation methods (Section~\ref{sec:method.definition}). We believe these issues are related to the higher observed accuracies for the TC metric.

\label{fig:gusmao_HINT_chipseq_rank}
\end{figure}

% Competing methods
Given its good performance, we evaluated the use of TC as the ranking strategy instead of each method's own ranking for the competing methods that present an intrinsic footprint scoring metric: BinDNase, Centipede, Cuellar, DNase2TF, FLR, PIQ and Wellington. Previous to ranking by TC, site-centric methods required the definition of a minimum probability score to define active footprints. We tested the probability cutoff thresholds of $80\%, 85\%, 90\%, 95\% $ and $99\%$ for the site-centric methods. The results can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_competing_chipseq_rank}. In all cases, using TC-based strategies/cutoff was significantly better than the methods original ranking ($p$-value $< 0.01$; Friedman-Nemenyi test). Concerning site-centric methods, the use of a probability threshold of $90\%$ was best for all methods except BinDNase, where $80\%$ was best.

% Conclusion
Given the results obtained in these empirical analyses, we selected the TC as the best footprint ranking metric. Furthermore, the TC is used for HINT and all competing methods with regard to the ChIP-seq evaluation approach on our comparative study.

% Section: Gene Expression Evaluation
\subsubsection{Gene Expression Evaluation}

% Correlation graphs
The gene expression evaluation consists on correlating differences in gene expression with a footprint quality score between two different cell types. Such correlation is termed FP-Exp. In this analysis, we evaluated three footprint quality scores: the TC, the FS and the footprint likelihood ratio (FLR) metric as suggested by~\cite{yardimci2014}. Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_fpexp_rank} shows a selection of graphs that exhibit the correlation between gene expression fold change (FC) and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic applied to the difference on the distribution between footprint quality scores for $143$ evaluated TFs. In this figure, we are able to observe that the FLR score presents high correlations ($r > 0.9$); while the TC metric presents low correlations ($r < 0.4$) and several cases in which the signal of KS and fold change disagree (off diagonal points).

\label{fig:gusmao_fpexp_rank}
\end{figure}

% Test
To investigate the footprint quality scores on the gene expression evaluation more thoroughly we generated the distribution of the FP-Exp using each of the tested footprint quality score metrics on all computational footprinting methods and all cell type pair combinations possible within the cell types GM12878, H1-hESC and K562 (Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_HINT_fpexp_rank}). Furthermore, to assess statistical significance we performed a Friedman-Nemenyi hypothesis test.

% Results
We observed that the FLR metric results in higher FP-Exp scores (average FP-Exp $= 0.79$) and significantly outperforms the results generated with the other footprint quality scores ($p$-value $< 0.05$ for FS and $p$-value $< 0.01$ for TC). The FS presented a lower average FP-Exp ($= 0.73$) than the FLR metric; however significantly outperformed the TC metric ($p$-value $< 0.01$). We also observed that the ranking of methods by FP-Exp using FLR metric and FS are very similar ($r=0.89$). Moreover, differently from what was observed for the ChIP-seq evaluation approach, the TC presents the lowest FP-Exp scores (average FP-Exp $= 0.35$).

% Conclusion
Given these results, we opt to use the FLR metric as the footprint quality score for our comparative study with regard to the gene expression evaluation approach. However, we point that the FS metric can be used as an alternative footprint quality score for the gene expression evaluation procedure given its simplicity and similar accuracies to FLR metric.

\subsection{Impact of DNase-seq Sequence Cleavage Bias}
\label{sec:impact.dnase.sequence.cleavage.bias}

% Introduction
In this section we investigate the impact of the DNase-seq sequence cleavage bias on the performance of HINT and whether the correction of such bias improves the footprint prediction accuracy. We tested the two approaches described in Section~\ref{sec:hint.signal.processing}: the ``DHS sequence bias'' and the ``naked deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence bias''. The DHS sequence bias considers the sequence bias estimates within DNase hypersensitivity sites (DHSs) of each DNase-seq experiment. This approach captures DNase I cleavage bias, read fragmentation and sequence complexity bias of DHSs of each DNase-seq experiment. The naked DNA sequence bias considers the sequence bias estimates within naked DNA DNase-seq experiments. In this case, all DNA regions are open, therefore the sequence bias estimates will mainly capture the DNase I cleavage bias.

% HINT, HINT-BC, HINT-BCN nomenclature
Throughout this section we used the following HINT variations: (1) HINT was applied without any DNase-seq sequence bias correction (HINT w/o BC), (2) HINT was applied with the DHS sequence bias correction approach (HINT bias-corrected; HINT-BC) and (3) HINT was applied with the naked DNA sequence bias correction approach (HINT bias-corrected on naked DNase-seq; HINT-BCN). This nomenclature will be used within this section.

\subsubsection{DNase-seq Sequence Cleavage Bias is Protocol-Specific}

% Clustering
First, to understand the nature of artifacts on DNase-seq experiments, we analyzed the DNase-seq sequence cleavage bias estimates on the {\tt Full Dataset}, i.e. all $61$ Tier 1 and Tier 2 DNase-seq datasets from~\cite{encode2012} (Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:dataencode.dnase}). The sequence cleavage bias corresponds to the $6$-mer estimations as shown in Equation~\ref{eq:cleavbias}. These experiments include two existing DNase-seq protocols: the single-hit and double-hit techniques. For every DNase-seq dataset we calculated the $6$-mer bias estimates for the cell-specific DHS sequence bias. Furthermore, we also included the naked DNA sequence bias estimates in this analysis from naked DNA DNase-seq experiments for three cell types. A clustering analysis of the correlation between the pairwise $6$-mer sequence bias estimates forms two clear groups, which splits experiments from single-hit and double-hit protocols (Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_bias_cluster_all}). This indicates that sequence biases are protocol-specific. Naked DNA sequence bias estimates forms a sub-cluster within estimates from the double-hit experiments.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Impact of the DNase-seq Sequence Cleavage bias on the Accuracy of Computational Footprinting Methods}

% OBS Figure
Next, we evaluated the influence of sequence bias on all footprinting methods. In this analysis we plot, for all computational footprinting methods, the TF-wise amount of bias \emph{vs} the TF-wise footprint prediction accuracy (Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_bias_obs}a). The amount of bias is calculated as the correlation between the uncorrected DNase-seq signal and the bias signal (Equation~\ref{eq:cleavbias}). Such correlation between observed DNase-seq and predicted bias signal is called ``OBS'' (observed \emph{vs} bias signal). The footprint prediction accuracy is measured through the ChIP-seq evaluation approach using the {\tt Benchmarking Dataset}.

% OBS Results
Our analysis shows that only six out of $14$ evaluated methods (Wellington, Neph, Boyle, DNase2TF, Centipede and FS-Rank) present a significant negative Spearman correlation ($r = -0.35$, $-0.32$, $-0.28$, $-0.28$, $-0.24$ and $-0.22$, respectively) between their accuracy performance and amount of sequence bias (Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_bias_obs}a; $p$-value $< 0.05$). Methods explicitly using $6$-mer sequence bias statistics (HINT-BC, HINT-BCN and FLR) or performing smoothing (Cuellar, BinDNase and PIQ) are not significantly influenced by sequence bias. Moreover, the performance of HINT-BC is the least affected by sequence bias ($r = -0.06$).

% OBS Results graphs
Nevertheless, we noticed an increase in accuracy for bias-corrected versions of HINT. The reason for such accuracy increase became clear when we examined the DNase-seq average signals, bias-corrected and without correction, surrounding active TFBSs. As an example, we show sequence bias estimates, corrected and uncorrected DNase-seq average profiles around TFBSs with the highest AUC gain between HINT-BC and HINT w/o BC (Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_bias_obs}b--c). The NRF1 and EGR1 DNase-seq profiles indicate that the bias-corrected signal fits better their sequence affinity than the uncorrected signal. This means that the higher-affinity parts of NRF1's and EGR1's motif are located in the regions with lowest DNase-seq cleavage. As a consequence, the distinctive pattern of active TF binding (i.e. grammar of active TFBSs) are more clearly recognizable in the bias-corrected DNase-seq signals than in the non-corrected DNase-seq signals.

\subsubsection{Statistical Evaluation of DNase-seq Sequence Cleavage Bias Correction Strategies}

% Distribution
Using the same experimental settings as explained in Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_bias_obs}, we have investigated more thoroughly the best DNase-seq sequence cleavage bias correction strategy. For that, we calculated the distribution of the AUC at $10\%$ FPR for HINT w/o BC, HINT-BC and HINT-BCN (Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_HINT_bias_comparison}). Furthermore, we performed a Friedman-Nemenyi hypothesis test on these three HINT scenarios.

% Comparative results
By analyzing these results, we are able to observe that, although HINT-BC presents slightly higher accuracies than HINT-BCN, these differences are not statistically significant. However, we are able to observe that the accuracies of the HINT-BC strategy significantly outperforms the HINT w/o BC. This is a strong indication that the DNase-seq sequence cleavage bias correction improves the performance of computational footprinting methods. This is an important result since no previous computational footprinting method that treated DNase-seq sequence cleavage bias observed significant gain in accuracy~\citep{yardimci2014,sung2014,kahara2015}. Given these results, the DHS sequence cleavage bias correction is the strategy of choice for the application of HINT in all other sections of this chapter.

\subsubsection{Evaluation of whether the DNase-seq Sequence Cleavage Bias Correction is an Artifact of the Genomic Nucleotide Frequency Distribution}

% CG content intro
Since the TFs have a sequence binding affinity preference, which in many cases is composed of C and G nucleotides, the DNase-seq sequence cleavage bias correction could be simply creating ``artifact'' peak-dip-peak patterns on the DNase-seq data, since the DNase I enzyme also has a preference to bind CG-rich motifs.

% CG content results
To investigate such claim we calculated the distribution of the pairwise AUC differences between the three HINT versions (HINT w/o BC, HINT-BC and HINT-BCN) for all TFs of the \linebreak {\tt Comprehensive Dataset} gold standard (Figure\ref{fig:gusmao_bias_cg}a). Furthermore, we also calculated the CG content of these TF motifs (Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_bias_cg}b). 

% CG content results
By analyzing Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_bias_cg}a--b we observe no correlation between CG content of the motifs and the individual AUC of each method: HINT (w/o BC) $ r = -0.0144$, HINT-BC $ r = 0.0254$ and HINT-BCN $ r = 0.0108$ ($p$-value $> 0.05$; Spearman correlation test). Furthermore, we observe no correlation between CG content of motifs and differences in AUC: HINT-BC $-$ HINT-BCN $ r = 0.0188$, HINT-BC $-$ HINT (w/o BC) $ r = 0.0724$ and HINT-BCN $-$ HINT (w/o BC) $ r = 0.0644$ ($p$-value $> 0.05$; Spearman correlation test). This is evidence that the significantly higher performance of HINT-BC over HINT is not due to artifacts generated by the bias correction strategy.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{DNase-seq Sequence Cleavage Bias Correction Decreases the Number of False Negatives}

% Contingency table test
To better understand in which experimental cases the DNase-seq sequence cleavage bias correction improves the accuracy of HINT, we generated DNase-seq profiles with uncorrected and bias-corrected signals in TFBSs that matched true positive (TP), false negative (FN), false positive (FP) and true negative (TN) predictions (i.e. the contingency table from the ChIP-seq evaluation scheme). The results of such analysis is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_bias_contingency_profile} for three selected TFs: GABP, NRF1 and EGR1. This figure shows, for all TFs and signal types, the clear peak-dip-peak DNase-seq profile (i.e. the grammar of active TFBSs) for the true positive predictions and a complete lack of such average pattern for the true negatives.

% Contingency table results
The profile around the false positive predictions are virtually the same between the uncorrected and bias-corrected DNase-seq signals. However, we are able to observe that the profiles around false negative predictions are significantly lower in intensity and different in shape ($p$-value $< 0.01$; Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon on the DNase-seq signal distribution at flanking regions and motif center) regarding the bias-corrected signal, in comparison to the uncorrected case. This shows that the DNase-seq sequence cleavage bias correction strategy enhances the accuracy by correctly predicting TFs that would not be otherwise predicted without such correction. Such observation is in line with the fact that we observe a clearer dip-peak-dip pattern in the average DNase-seq signal for multiple TFs (Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_bias_obs}b--c).

\label{fig:gusmao_bias_contingency_profile}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Uncorrected DNase-seq Signal may Lead to Inaccurate TF Binding Predictions}

% Conclusion / de novo motifs
An example that ignoring experimental artifacts might lead to false predictions can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_neph_denovo_bias}. In this figure we show the DNase-seq profile for two motifs (termed 0458 and 0500) found using Neph's footprint predictions which did not match any existing known motif (i.e. \emph{de novo} TF motifs). These \emph{de novo} motifs were reported in~\cite{neph2012a}. Bias corrected DNase-seq profiles reveal very weak footprint shape. Furthermore, we compared the overlap between footprints generated by HINT-BC and Neph in the same cell type in which these \emph{de novo} motifs were found (H7-hESC). We observed that $24.99\%$ (motif 0458) and $28.58\%$ (motif 0500) of MPBSs associated with a Neph footprint. In contrast, only $0.73\%$ (motif 0458) and $1.71\%$ (motif 0500) of MPBSs overlapped with a HINT-BC footprint. Altogether, this indicates that these motifs are indeed potential artifacts of sequence cleavage bias (as Neph's method do not use any bias correction strategy) and reinforces the importance of bias correction prior to any DNase-seq analysis.

In this section we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of HINT and all competing computational footprinting methods. Since most competing methods use only DNase-seq data, we used the \textsc{DNase-only} HINT topology for a fairer comparison~\cite{rusk2015}. Furthermore, the accuracies presented in this section were calculated using all chromosomes but the chromosome 1, since data from such chromosome was used to perform method parameter selection. HINT's DNase-seq sequence cleavage bias correction strategy followed the DHS cleavage bias scheme. Both HINT and competing methods were executed exactly as described in Chapter~\ref{cha:experiments}.

% Introduction subsections
The computational footprinting method comparison was performed using: (1) the ChIP-seq evaluation method with the {\tt Benchmarking Dataset} (Section~\ref{sec:mc.chipseq.evaluation}) and (2) the gene expression evaluation method (Section~\ref{sec:mc.gene.expression.evaluation}). We close this section with a discussion on both evaluation methodologies in a general comparison showing the full experimental result's picture (Section~\ref{sec:integrated.comparison}).

\subsection{ChIP-seq Evaluation}
\label{sec:mc.chipseq.evaluation}

% Intro - ROC / PR
In the ChIP-seq evaluation approach, we create ROC and precision-recall (PR) curves for each method on the prediction of each TF in our {\tt Benchmark Dataset}. Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_roc_pr} shows examples of ROC and PR curves for the TFs EGR1, GABP and C-JUN. At first glance we are able to observe that the site-centric baseline methods FP-Rank and PWM-Rank present the lowest accuracies. Furthermore, the site-centric baseline method TC-Rank and the segmentation baseline method Filter exhibit a good performance. The Filter method often outperformed more complex computational footprinting methods (Cuellar, FLR and Centipede). The higher-ranked computational footprinting methods (HINT, DNase2TF and PIQ) have very close AUC at $100\%$ FPR. However, the PR curves in Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_roc_pr} show us that these methods compete with regard to the delay in sensitivity decrease as specificity increases. This is the main reason in which we also calculated the AUC at lower FPR levels and the area under the PR curve (AUPR).

\label{fig:gusmao_roc_pr}
\end{figure}

% Boxplot
To have a better perspective of the results for all methods and TFs tested we calculated the distribution of the AUC at $100\%$, $10\%$ and $1\%$ FPR as well as the AUPR (Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_chipseq_method_comparison}). AUC at lower FPRs favors methods with higher sensitivity in expense of specificity. Also, AUC at lower FPRs tend to get closer results to the AUPR, which is ideal for very imbalanced classification problems. We observe the importance of using cell-specific open chromatin data (in this case, DNase-seq) by analyzing the dramatic increase in accuracy from the PWM method to all other methods that use such open chromatin data. The only exception to this remark is the FS-Rank method, which uses DNase-seq data but does present lower average accuracies than the PWM method. However, note that the FS metric, when combined with footprint predictions, generally present higher accuracies than the PWM metric (see ``Gene Expression Evaluation'' in Section~\ref{sec:footprint.ranking.strategy}). The reason for such lower FS-Rank accuracies stems from its inability to model the length of the DNase-seq depletion and peaks given that the FS-Rank relies on a fixed-window length strategy.

% Comparison
Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_chipseq_method_comparison} shows that the HINT method is the best method with regard to all metrics tested. HINT is closely followed by DNase2TF, PIQ and Wellington. It is interesting to observe that all segmentation methods are in the top-six positions of the rank for all metrics. This suggests that segmentation methods outperform site-centric approaches on the detection of active binding sites. Moreover, the results from the different evaluation statistics (AUC at different FDR thresholds and AUPR) result in very similar rankings ($r > 0.98$).

\subsection{Gene Expression Evaluation}
\label{sec:mc.gene.expression.evaluation}

% Introduction
In the gene expression evaluation approach, we calculate the correlation between changes in gene expression for a number of TFs with differences in the quality of footprint predictions for these factors. To measure the change in gene expression we use the gene expression fold change (FC). The quality metric of footprints used is the footprint likelihood ratio (FLR) metric~\citep{yardimci2014}. Differences in such footprint quality metric is measured with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test statistic. The Spearman correlation between FLR score difference and expression FC, which we refer to as FP-Exp, will be used to rank footprinting methods. Higher FP-Exp values indicate better performance. The gene expression evaluation methodology only requires expression data and is therefore more generally applicable than the ChIP-seq evaluation. However, differently from the ChIP-seq evaluation, the gene expression approach cannot evaluate footprint predictions of individual TFs.

% Method-wise results
In Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_fpexp_method_comparison} we show the top four methods with regard to the gene expression evaluation. Since a single FP-Exp is evaluated for a collection of TFs, it is not possible to graphically display the distribution of accuracies as in the ChIP-seq evaluation scheme. Nevertheless, we are able to observe that HINT is again the top-ranked method, followed by DNase2TF, Neph and FLR.

\end{figure}

% General results
We observed high average FP-Exp values for the majority of evaluated methods (FP-Exp $ = 0.79$) and very high FP-Exp values (FP-Exp $ > 0.9$) for the four top performing methods on comparisons between pairs of cell types H1-hESC, K562 and GM12878 (Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_fpexp_method_comparison}). Moreover, similar rankings of methods are obtained for each cell pair: H1-hESC/K562 \textit{vs} H1-hESC/GM12878 $r = 0.99$, H1-hESC/K562 \textit{vs} GM12878/K562 $r = 0.96$, and H1-hESC/GM12878 \textit{vs} GM12878/K562 $r = 0.97$. We also observed a high agreement between the ranking of computational footprinting methods using the gene expression evaluation methodology and the ranking of methods using the ChIP-seq evaluation approach ($r > 0.88$).

\subsection{General Comparison}
\label{sec:integrated.comparison}

% Figure and FN
We integrated all the computational footprinting method's results to perform a global comparison. Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_method_comparison} shows the ranking of all computational footprinting methods with regard to all evaluation metrics: FP-Exp, AUCs (at $100\%$, $10\%$ and $1\%$ FPR) and AUPR. Furthermore, we combined all these results and performed a Friedman-Nemenyi test for statistical significance (Table~\ref{tab:fn.table.aupr}).

% Results
HINT has the highest FP-Exp, AUC and AUPR values and significantly outperforms all methods ($p$-value $< 0.01$). The next top performing method is DNase2TF, which significantly outperforms all other methods except PIQ ($p$-value $< 0.05$ for Wellington; $p$-value $< 0.01$ for all others). PIQ outperforms all of its lower ranked competitors but Wellington ($p$-value $< 0.05$ for Neph; $p$-value $< 0.01$ for all others). The segmentation methods HINT, DNase2TF, Wellington and Neph are ranked within the top five methods regarding all evaluation metrics, individually. Boyle is the only segmentation method not included within the top five; however it displayed good accuracies (placed $6^{\text{th}}$ in the global ranking). The site-centric method PIQ obtained the best accuracies among the site-centric methods (placed $3^{\text{rd}}$ in the global ranking). All site-centric baseline methods (FS-Rank, PWM-Rank and TC-Rank) are in the bottom four positions of the ranks. These results lead us to claim that the segmentation approach is preferable over the site-centric approach.

\section{Impact of Transcription Factor Residence Time}
\label{sec:impact.tf.residence.time}

% Introduction - nuclear receptors
Despite the high average prediction values of top performing footprint methods, they consistently perform worst in a similar set of TFs, i.e. HINT, DNase2TF and PIQ have $89\%$ of TFs in common in the lower quartile of AUC at $10\%$ FPR. This list includes nuclear receptors, which has low residence binding time~\citep{sung2014} and display a lower DNase I cleavage protection pattern (Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_receptor_bias}). A careful analysis of Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_receptor_bias} shows that, while corrected DNase-seq profiles from ER have a better match with the underlying motif, this is not the case for AR and GR. However, we observed a small gain in the AUC score comparing HINT (with DHS sequence cleavage bias correction) and HINT (without bias correction). This difference is in the upper quartile range for all $233$ TFs analyzed from the {\tt Comprehensive Dataset}. These results indicate that sequence cleavage bias correction also brings improvements to footprint prediction of nuclear receptors. However, all these nuclear receptor TFs have low AUC scores in all footprinting methods, i.e. lower quartiles for HINT or TC AUC score. This indicates that short binding time indeed poses a challenge in footprint prediction.

% Protection score def
To further investigate this, we propose a statistic -- termed protection score -- inspired by the concepts presented by~\cite{sung2014} to detect TFs with potential short residence time. The protection score measures the difference between the amounts of DNase I digestion in the flanking regions and within the TFBS on bias-corrected DNase-seq signals. More formally, the protection score for a genomic region $r_i = [u, v]$ is defined as
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:prot}
  \text{PROTECTION}_{r_i} = \frac{({n}^{R}_{r_i} - {n}^{C}_{r_i}) + ({n}^{L}_{r_i} - {n}^{C}_{r_i})}{2N},
\end{align}
where ${n}_{C,i}$, ${n}_{L,i}$  ${n}_{L,i}$ are the number of DNase-seq reads within, upstream and downstream of the genomic region $r_i$, respectively (Equation~\ref{eq:fs2}).

% Protection score info
In short, the protection score indicates the average difference of DNase-seq counts in the flanking region and the within TFBSs. Positive values will indicate protection in the flanking regions, while values close to zero or negative indicate no protection. The protection score is similar to the FS. The main difference is that the FS score measures the ratio between reads in flanking \textit{vs} binding sites, while the protection score measures the difference.

\label{fig:gusmao_receptor_bias}
\end{figure}

% Protection test
We used the protection score to analyze the predictive performance of methods on TFs with distinct residence time. For this, we used the TFs from the {\tt Comprehensive Dataset}. We observed that TFs with known short residence time on DNA, such as nuclear receptors AR~\citep{tewari2012}, ER~\citep{sharp2006} and GR~\citep{mcnally2000}, present a negative protection score (Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_residence_time}a). TFs with intermediate and long residence time on DNA (C-JUN~\citep{malnou2010} and CTCF~\citep{nakahashi2013}, respectively) present a positive protection score. The amount of protection is clearly reflected in the bias-corrected DNase-seq profiles (Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_residence_time}b--d). In addition, Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_residence_time}a also reveals an association of the protection score and the performance of HINT. Overall, the protection score positively correlates with the AUC values of evaluated methods, such as TC-Rank ($r = 0.19$) and HINT ($r = 0.26$), and negatively correlates ($r = -0.49$) with the sequence bias (adjusted $p$-value $< 0.05$). These results reinforce the concept that TFs with potential short residence time are poorly detected via DNase-seq footprints in comparison to TFs with higher residence time. Nevertheless, in the absence of biological experimental data on the residence time of TFs, the protection score can be used to identify TFs with potential short residence time and can be an important tool on experiments involving computational footprinting methods.

\section{\emph{De Novo} Motif Finding on Predicted Footprints}
\label{sec:denovo.motif.finding.footprints}

% Introduction
The predicted footprints from a segmentation computational footprinting approach represent a map of active TFBSs. In possession of such regulatory landscape one might be able to perform many downstream analysis. Here we present an example of such analysis -- the \emph{de novo} motif finding. This analysis consists on searching for novel TF DNA affinity sequences which do not match any known affinity sequence in the literature.

% Method
We performed a \emph{de novo} motif finding analysis on all $738,707$ footprints predicted by HINT on cell type H1-hESC as described in Section~\ref{sec:denovo.motif.finding}. After the initial motif matching to filter out footprints that match with known TFs, we are left with \approxy$5.37\%$ ($39,703$) of H1-hESC's footprints. The tools ``discriminative regular expression motif elicitation'' (DREME) and ``local motif enrichment analysis'' (CENTRIMO) were applied to these filtered footprints.

% Results
Given the quality scores given by DREME and CENTRIMO, we were able to find six frequent motifs in H1-hESC which did not match with any existing motif from the repositories used. Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_denovo} shows these six motifs and their DREME $p$-value. Each motif is named after its IUPAC consensus sequence standards. We also show in Figure~\ref{fig:gusmao_denovo} the average DNase-seq signal on a $200$ bp window around each of these \emph{de novo} motifs (DNase-seq profile graph). We are able to see that, with exception of the TACCCR motif, all other motifs presented a very clear peak-dip-peak DNase-seq pattern, consistent with the grammar of active TFBSs. Furthermore, the motifs CKCSGAG and CCGGAGHC present very clear signs of co-binding. This can be seen as a pattern of multiple dips with a $10$--$15$ bp spacing between them, instead of a single dip in the middle of the DNase-seq profile graphs.

Each motif is named after its IUPAC consensus sequence (bold, top of each graph) and the $p$-value of the DREME analysis is also shown. The graphs represent the average DNase-seq signal around a $200$ bp window centered on MPBSs found in the whole genome after applying each \emph{de novo} position frequency matrix. The motif sequence logo is shown below each \emph{de novo} motif's graph.}

\end{figure}

% Conclusion
Needless to say, such \emph{de novo} motifs need to be experimentally validated using biological methods. However, the fact that we are able to see a peak-dip-peak pattern on the DNase-seq profile is a clear indication of active TF binding. The intent of this analysis is to show an example of downstream analysis using footprints predicted with HINT. In Section~\ref{sec:case.studies} we will show the application of footprints on real biological scenarios in which positive inferences could be performed.

\section{HINT Case Studies -- Identification of Regulatory TFs involved in Different Biological Conditions}
\label{sec:case.studies}

% Introduction
In this section we show two case studies in which our computational footprinting method was successfully used to identify key regulatory players on two different biological analyses. The first case study regards the identification of key regulatory TFs on the differentiation of dendritic cells in mouse (Section~\ref{sec:case.study.dendritic}). The second case study concerns the identification of TFs associated to (i.e. binds together with) the NF-$\kappa$B TF, which is a key regulator on the mammalian inflammatory response (Section~\ref{sec:case.study.nfkb}). Both case studies exhibit a similar experimental workflow. Briefly, we first apply HINT to detect footprint predictions in different cellular conditions. Then, we compare these different cellular conditions to find the TFs more likely to be associated with each condition. For that, we use the TF enrichment analysis as described in Section~\ref{sec:transcription.factor.enrichment.analysis}.

% Disclaimer
All the results shown in this section represent a subset of the analyses which were published in papers co-authored by this thesis' author. More specifically, the results shown in Section~\ref{sec:case.study.dendritic} were published and authored by~\cite{lin2015} and the results shown in Section~\ref{sec:case.study.nfkb} were published and authored by~\cite{kolovos2016}.

\subsection{Case Study: Regulatory Network during Differentiation of Dendritic Cells}
\label{sec:case.study.dendritic}

% Introduction
This case study focuses on dendritic cells (DCs). DCs are professional antigen-presenting cells that develop from hematopoietic stem cells through successive steps of lineage commitment and differentiation~\citep{merad2013,belz2012}. Here, we focus on four cell types which represent such lineage commitment steps: multipotent progenitors (MPPs), common DC progenitors (CDPs), classical DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). Multipotent progenitors (MPPs) are committed to common DC progenitors (CDPs), which further differentiate into specific DC subsets: the classical DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs)~\citep{belz2012,lin2015}. The understanding of DC differentiation is important since it has impact on the further understanding of adaptive immune responses~\citep{merad2013}.

% Goals of study
The goal of this study is to understand the regulatory circuitry that determines the differentiation of MPPs to CDPs and CDPs to either cDCs or pDCs. It is known that the TF PU.1 is an important factor within this cell differentiation framework~\citep{belz2012}. The TF PU.1 is a master regulator, since it initiates differentiation events and are associated to many other TFs. In this section we show the results regarding our investigation of TFs which are significantly associated to PU.1.

% Here
In this study, ChIP-seq experiments were performed for several histone modifications, including H3K4me1~\citep{lin2015}. With the goal to capture the regulatory landscape of dendritic cell differentiation associated to the PU.1 master regulator, we performed a TF enrichment analysis using:

\begin{itemize}
\item Only the PU.1 ChIP-seq peaks (i.e. PU.1 TFBSs). This analysis do not involve any footprinting. The rationale of this analysis is to find TFs associated to the PU.1 master regulator.
\item Footprints predicted with HINT on data from the H3K4me1 ChIP-seq that are also associated with (i.e. close to) PU.1 TFBSs. The rationale of this analysis is to verify if footprints can enhance the specificity of the TF enrichment analysis.
\item Footprints predicted with HINT on data from the H3K4me1 ChIP-seq that are not associated with PU.1 TFBSs. The rationale of this analysis is to find TFs which are associated to DC differentiation but do not necessarily associate with the PU.1 master regulator.
\end{itemize}

This analysis, which is a part of the study performed by~\cite{lin2015}, is presented as a case study for our computational footprinting framework in the next subsections.

\subsubsection{Computational Footprinting}

% Computational Footprinting
We applied the \textsc{histone-only} HINT model (see ``\textsc{Histone-only Model}'' in Section~\ref{sec:hmm.topology}) to the H3K4me1 ChIP-seq data. We followed the experimental settings as described in Chapter~\ref{cha:experiments}. Briefly, we extended the H3K4me1 enriched regions by $5,000$ bp to each side and applied our \textsc{histone-only} HMM model trained with H3K4me1 data from random genomic regions. Given the lower resolution of ChIP-seq data and the nature of the probabilistic model, footprints from H3K4me1 tend to span larger regions. Therefore, we further reduced the footprint predictions by considering only $250$ bp to the left (downstream) and right (upstream) of its center.

% TF enrichment analysis
As aforementioned, we performed three TF enrichment analyses: (1) on PU.1 peaks, (2) on \linebreak H3K4me1 footprints that overlap PU.1 peaks and (3) on H3K4me1 footprints that do not overlap PU.1 peaks. These three definitions of target genomic region sets for the TF enrichment analysis were used for data on the four different cells being analyzed: MPPs, CDPs, cDCs and pDCs. In all tests, the size of the background genomic region sets were $100$ times higher than the size of the target genomic region sets.

% Intersection
Figure~\ref{fig:lin_footprint_enrichment_s8}a shows the overlap between H3K4me1 footprints and PU.1 ChIP-seq enriched regions (peaks). We can observe different levels of overlap. A higher overlap was found on more specialized cells (cDC; \approxy$68\%$ of H3K4me1 footprints overlap with PU.1 peaks) in contrast to less specialized cells (MPP; \approxy$23\%$ of H3K4me1 footprints overlap with PU.1 peaks). These results are consistent with gene expression information obtained with DNA microarray analyses, which shows higher expression of PU.1 in cDC than MPP~\citep{lin2015}.

% Three enrichment analysis - PU.1 and H3K4me1 footprints
We present here the three TF enrichment analyses results, using as the target genomic region set: (1) only PU.1 peaks (Figure~\ref{fig:lin_footprint_enrichment_s8}b); (2) H3K4me1 footprints that overlap PU.1 peaks (Figure~\ref{fig:lin_footprint_enrichment_s8}c) and (3) in H3K4me1 footprints that did not overlap PU.1 peaks (Figure~\ref{fig:lin_footprint_enrichment_s8}d). The $p$-values from the TF enrichment analyses are presented as a heatmap. The enrichment is represented in a gray to blue scale. A gray heatmap entry represent no enrichment ($p$-value $> 0.05$) for the TF represented in the row at the cell type represented in the column. A blue heatmap entry represents evidence of enrichment ($p$-value $< 0.05$). Enriched TFs were separated in different clusters (numbered I to VI) given their different enrichment levels in different cells. 

% Results TFs
We were able to detect many TFs involved in DC differentiation. For instance, in the footprint+PU.1 TF enrichment analysis shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lin_footprint_enrichment_s8}c we observed the binding of the pioneer PU.1 alongside evidence of KLF4 and RUNX1 in MPP. The AP1-like TFs (FOS and JUN) and some IRF factors (IRF2, IRF4 and IRF5) appear to be cDC-specific. This means that these factors might have some role on the differentiation from CDP to cDC cell type. On the other hand, TCF factors (TCF3 and TCF4), EGR1 and KLF4 appear to play a role in the differentiation from CDP to pDC cell type.

% Results main
Interestingly, the TF enrichment analysis performed in H3K4me1 footprints captured most of the PU.1-only enrichment analysis. Furthermore, the H3K4me1 footprint analyses recovered two TFs (CEBPB and BHLHE40; marked in red in Figure~\ref{fig:lin_footprint_enrichment_s8}c--d) which were not found by the PU.1-only enrichment analysis.

% Conclusion
The results presented here demonstrate the power of computational footprinting coupled with the TF enrichment analysis to increase the specificity of biological analyses. The H3K4me1 footprints represent regulatory regions and were shown to have a high overlap (\approxy$80\%$) with open chromatin regions~\citep{lin2015}. The H3K4me1 footprint predictions were used to search for TFs which act in conjunction with PU.1 master regulator or independently from the PU.1 master regulator. Such results, combined with other experimental data and knowledge from previous studies, were used to devise a regulatory network on the differentiation of dendritic cells. The complete results of these experiments are in~\cite{lin2015}.

\subsection{Case Study: Multimodal Role of NF-$\kappa$B during Intermmediate-Early Inflammatory Response}
\label{sec:case.study.nfkb}

% Introduction
This case study focuses on the inflammatory mechanism of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In this study, we focused on the TF NF-$\kappa$B. This TF is a key regulator of inflammatory mechanisms~\citep{hayden2012}. However, NF-$\kappa$B has still many unknown features with regard to its interaction with other TFs and chromatin dynamic processes~\citep{hayden2012}. In HUVECs, the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF$\alpha$) acutely remodels the cell’s transcriptional program, but our understanding of how the activation of proinflammatory genes is achieved at the expense of the ongoing transcriptional program is far from complete~\citep{kempe2005}. It is known that NF-$\kappa$B predominantly ``hijacks'' the regulatory machinery of the cell by binding already-active enhancers, more than half of which do not carry NF-$\kappa$B recognition motifs.

% Goals of study
The goal of this study is to understand the different regulatory players involved in enhancers (i.e. distal regulatory regions) in which:

\begin{itemize}
\item NF-$\kappa$B is found (ChIP-seq peak evidence) and the NF-$\kappa$B recognition motif is present (in the DNA).
\item NF-$\kappa$B is found and the NF-$\kappa$B recognition motif is not present.
\end{itemize}

For that, we obtained DNase-seq data from HUVEC cells and applied HINT to identify footprints. Then, we were able to perform a TF enrichment analysis on the genomic regions that carry the NF-$\kappa$B recognition motifs and that do not carry such motif, to understand the regulatory players involved in assisting the binding of NF-$\kappa$B in the absence of its canonical DNA motif. This analysis, which is a part of the study performed by~\cite{kolovos2016}, is presented as a case study for our computational footprinting framework in the next subsections.

\subsubsection{Computational Footprinting}

% Data
DNase-seq raw DNA sequences (reads) from HUVECs were obtained from~\cite{encode2012}. The data is available in the gene expression omnibus (GEO) repository with accession number GSM816646. The short reads from the DNase-seq experiment were aligned to the human reference genome~\citep{encode2012} using Bowtie~\citep{langmead2012}. To identify the DHSs (DNase-seq enriched regions), the software F-seq~\citep{boyle2008b} was applied to the aligned reads (using the procedure described in Section~\ref{sec:hint.signal.processing}).

% Computational Footprinting
Then, we applied the \textsc{DNase-only} HINT model (see ``\textsc{DNase-only Model}'' in Section~\ref{sec:hmm.topology}) to the DNase-seq data. We followed the experimental settings as described in Chapter~\ref{cha:experiments}. Briefly, we extended the DHSs by $5,000$ bp to each side and applied our \textsc{DNase-only} HMM model trained with DNase-seq data from the HUVEC experiments presented in this thesis.

% TF Enrichment Analysis
The resulting footprint predictions from the \textsc{DNase-only} HINT were separated in two categories. The footprint predictions that overlaps NF-$\kappa$B ChIP-seq enriched regions (peaks)~\citep{papantonis2012} that: (1) carries the canonical NF-$\kappa$B motif and (2) do not carry such motif. Then we performed a TF enrichment analysis in these two different conditions, considering the footprint predictions (overlapping NF-$\kappa$B peaks) as our target genomic region set. In both TF enrichment analyses the background genomic regions correspond to random regions in the human genome. The size of the background genomic region sets were $100$ times higher than the size of the target genomic region sets.

\subsubsection{Results}

% Introduction
NF-$\kappa$B binding predominantly occurs at already-active (upon inflammation stimuli) distal regulatory regions called enhancers. These are mostly intragenic, display little overlap with CTCF-bound sites, and half carry the canonical motif or remain bound by NF-$\kappa$B at $60$ min after inflammatory stimulation. To obtain a more precise view of NF-$\kappa$B binding choices, we performed a TF enrichment analysis on DNase-seq footprints. The analysis consists on comparing two different genomic region sets: (1) NF-$\kappa$B ChIP-seq enriched regions (peaks) at enhancer regions with the canonical NF-$\kappa$B motif and (2) NF-$\kappa$B ChIP-seq enriched regions (peaks) at enhancer regions without the canonical NF-$\kappa$B motif.

% Heatmap
The result of the TF enrichment analysis can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:kolovos_footprint_enrichment_2c}. We exhibit a heatmap that combines the two conditions tested. The color code is a gradient from blue (TFs enriched in NF-$\kappa$B peaks with motif) to white (no enrichment) to red (TFs enriched in NF-$\kappa$B peaks without motif).

% Results main
As expected, REL-like TFs (REL, RELA and NF-$\kappa$B1) are enriched in the NF-$\kappa$B peaks with canonical motif, since their DNA recognition motif are very similar to the canonical NF-$\kappa$B motif. Furthermore, the TFs KLF4, KLF7, ZNF281 and EGR1 appear to be significantly enriched in these regions. Among these factors, there are the TNF$\alpha$-induced REL, RELA, NF-$\kappa$B1, KLF7 and EGR1. On the other hand, we observe that the JUN-related TFs JUN, JUND, JUNB, FOS, FOS, FOSL1 and FOSL2 are significantly associated to NF-$\kappa$B-binding enhancer regions without the canonical NF-$\kappa$B motif. The only TNF$\alpha$-repressed TF that appeared in our enrichment analysis -- SOX17 -- appears to be slightly associated to the regions without NF-$\kappa$B motif. The implications of such discovery are still under investigation. The mechanisms behind these NF-$\kappa$B-associated TFs and human inflammatory response are further explored in~\cite{kolovos2016}.

% Further evidence
In summary, the analysis have shown that REL-like TFs (RELA and NF-$\kappa$B1) are markedly enriched at the NF-$\kappa$B peaks with canonical motif; whereas JUN-like TFs (JUN and FOS) appear to be enriched at the NF-$\kappa$B peaks without canonical motif. Further analyses show that the footprint enrichment analysis prediction is backed by~\cite{encode2012} ChIP-seq data from HUVECs, where co-binding of NF-$\kappa$B and JUN/FOS (and to a lesser extent GATA2) was most prominent at enhancers without NF-$\kappa$B recognition sites.

% Conclusion
Differently from the previous case study, in which different cell types were being analyzed for regulatory elements within their open chromatin regions; the analysis presented in this case study was based on two conditions which differed only in the presence/absence of the NF-$\kappa$B motif. In this case, the usage of DNase-seq alleviates much of the noise from intervening unbound sequences. The results presented in this section, combined with other experimental data, were used to understand the mechanisms behind hijacked enhancers and the regulatory role of NF-$\kappa$B in the human inflammatory mechanism. The complete results of these experiments are found in~\cite{kolovos2016}.
