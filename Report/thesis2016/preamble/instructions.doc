Dear Prof. Decker,





please find attached my Ph.D. dissertation for your examination. An identical copy was also delivered to the “Promotionsbüro” and to all other referees.



As agreed by the members of the Ph.D. thesis committee, the tentative defense date is 15.December.2016 at 9:00. In order to be able to make such defense date work, I would kindly ask you to return my thesis' examination between 17.October.2016 and 31.October.2016. If you can not deliver the examination within this period, please let me know so we can schedule another tentative defense date.

Furthermore, as you might know, my thesis is highly interdisciplinary. The thesis was written with a higher focus on the area of “computer science”. However, it also presents some results in the area of “molecular biology”. I would like to kindly ask you to consider such multidisciplinary trend of modern science as a positive feature.



I am very happy to have you as a referee in my Ph.D. thesis committee. I hope you enjoy the reading as much as I enjoyed the writing and the wonderful learning environment I had in RWTH University Aachen.

If you have any question, please do not hesitate in contacting me through:

Best regards,

Eduardo Gade Gusmao
