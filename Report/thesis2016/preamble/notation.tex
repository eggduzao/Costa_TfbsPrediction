\markright{\MakeUppercase{\nomname}}

In this thesis, the mathematical structures are represented using the following notation:
\begin{itemize}
\item All \emph{numbers}, \emph{characters} and \emph{intervals} are represented by lowecase symbols, e.g. $a$. Intervals are defined using square brackets, e.g. $a = [0,1]$.
\item All \emph{sets} (numeric or categorical) are represented by uppercase symbols, e.g. $A$. Sets represent a group of elements in which the order does not have significance. Sets are defined using the curly brackets (braces), e.g. $A = \{a_1, \cdots, a_n \}$.
\item All \emph{vectors} (numeric or categorical) are represented by lowecase bold symbols, e.g. $\mathbf{a}$. Vectors represent an ordered group of elements. Vectors are represented by angle brackets (chevrons), i.e. $\mathbf{a} = \langle a_1, \cdots, a_n \rangle$.
\item All \emph{matrices} (numeric or categorical) are represented by uppercase bold symbols, e.g. $\mathbf{A}$. Matrices are represented either by curly brackets (braces), i.e. $\mathbf{A} = {\{a_{uv}\}}^{m \times n}$, where $m$ and $n$ represent, respectively, the number of rows and columns; or by a vector of vectors, i.e. $\mathbf{A} = \langle \mathbf{a}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{a}_n \rangle$.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The following symbols are used in this thesis. The wildcard symbol $\ast$ will be used to denote a number, vector, matrix or set.
