Berlage's Comments 2:

1. Add full comprehension of what chapters 3 and 4 are in: a) the introduction and b) in the beginning of chapters 3 and 4.

Comment: I am not fully clear what is the difference between chapters 3 and 4. They do seem to be a sort of continuation.

-----------

2. Tag chapters as method or results.

Comment: Some other methods you use are introduced in 5. While I am not a fan of completely separating methods and results, you might be able to somehow tag the subchapters when you are introducing a method or procedure and when you present results, or discuss results. Otherwise, the sequence should stay as it is, as things are introduced where they are needed.

3. Enhance Section 5.6 for computational reviewers.

Comment: In 5.6.1 the first sentence on p98 has no subject.
Comment: I found 5.6.1 very hard to comprehend. Why are you looking for an overlap with PU.1. It is not fully clear (i have an idea) what the overlap or non-overlap tells you. And there is no explanation of PU.1. In general, the results are very brief and cannot be understood withoutr some additional biological knowledge (from the papers). That is a pity and you should expand those sections and explain the biological background (in simple terms). Same applies to 5.6.2. You are referring to „as expected“, but that is a biologists expectation that I cannot follow.
